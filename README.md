## About Leetcode 

Leetcode is the site where I practice my coding skills for enhancing them and becoming a better programmer. It contains multiple solutions of a certain problem. When you give your solution for a particular problem it compares it with existing solutions and rank your it.

## Languages

I have used following languages for solving leetcode problems 
- Java
- Python 

## Structure of repo

For a single leetcode problem I have uploaded a folder which contains a code file (.py or .java) and a description file file which contains the description of problem and solution i wrote for it.
